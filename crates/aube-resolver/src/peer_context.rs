//! Peer-dependency post-processing over an already-resolved graph.
//!
//! Two user-visible passes live here:
//!
//! * [`hoist_auto_installed_peers`] — promotes peers declared by direct
//!   dependencies up to importer direct deps, matching pnpm's
//!   `auto-install-peers=true` behavior. Idempotent on graphs that already
//!   ship with those hoists (npm v7+ output, lockfile-driven installs).
//! * [`apply_peer_contexts`] — computes pnpm-style `(peer@ver)` suffixes
//!   on contextualized `dep_path`s. Drives the sibling-symlink wiring in
//!   `aube-linker` so each subtree that pins different peer versions gets
//!   its own virtual-store entry.
//!
//! [`detect_unmet_peers`] reports what the two passes above couldn't wire
//! up, so the CLI can surface warnings.
//!
//! Call order from `Resolver::resolve`: `hoist_auto_installed_peers`
//! (fresh resolves only) → `apply_peer_contexts` → `detect_unmet_peers`.

/// Cycles: protected by `visiting` — if a package is re-entered via a
/// dependency cycle, we return the already-computed dep_path without
/// recursing again. The peer context is fixed at first visit; any cycle
/// traversal uses whatever context was live at that first visit.
///
/// Nested peer suffixes: pnpm writes `(react-dom@18.2.0(react@18.2.0))`
/// when a declared peer has its own resolved peers. A single top-down
/// DFS pass can't produce that form, because when a parent P records
/// a peer version in its children's scope, it only knows the canonical
/// tail — the peer's OWN suffix is computed later when the peer itself
/// gets visited. We solve this by running `apply_peer_contexts_once` in
/// a fixed-point loop: the second iteration's input has Pass 1's
/// contextualized tails in every `pkg.dependencies` map, so when a
/// descendant looks a peer up in ancestor scope it sees the full
/// nested tail and serializes it as such. Most peer chains converge in

///
/// pnpm-parity gate (inferred from observed lockfile shape): **a
/// package gets descendant-peer propagation only if its own
/// `peerDependencies` map is empty.** Packages that declare their
/// own peers have an authoritative self-suffix encoding exactly the
/// peers they care about; descendant peers don't bubble through
/// because the descendant peers belong to a NESTED child, which the
/// snapshot already encodes via the nested-tail form (see
/// `apply_peer_contexts_once`'s nested-suffix handling). Two
/// observable shapes this gate lines up with:
///   - `@testing-library/react@14.0.0(react@18.2.0)(react-dom@18.2.0(react@18.2.0))`
///     — declares peers, gets self-suffix only; `@types/react` from a
///     descendant doesn't bubble up.
///   - `abc-parent-with-missing-peers@1.0.0(peer-a@…)(peer-b@…)(peer-c@…)`
///     — no declared peers, picks up descendant peers from `abc`.
///
/// Algorithm:
///  1. Build a forward dep map: `pkg_key → [child_key]` from each
///     LockedPackage's `dependencies`.
///  2. Memoized DFS. For each node, compute
///     `cumulative_segments = outer_paren_segments(node.key)`. If the
///     node has no declared peers, also union in
///     `⋃ cumulative(child)` (gated by the rule above).
///  3. Cycles short-circuit via a `visiting` guard — cycle members
///     can't add new peers from each other beyond what reaches them
///     through non-cycle paths, so returning the empty set on
///     re-entry is safe (the non-cycle entry path computes the full
///     set).
///  4. Dedupe by peer name. Suppressed names: every peer name reachable
///     transitively in self-segments (so `(helper@1(core@1))` covers
///     `core` and a flat `(core@1)` from descendants is dropped) plus
///     the package's own canonical name (mutual-peer cycle break).
///  5. Build a rewrite map `old_key → new_key` and apply to package
///     keys, dep edges (each dep's stored tail), and importer

    // Resolution source priority for each declared peer:
    //   1. Ancestor scope — if the ancestor's version actually
    //      satisfies the declared peer range. Different subtrees
    //      naturally see different ancestors (lib-a in subtree-A
    //      and lib-b in subtree-B keep their own peer pins), so
    //      preferring the closest ancestor here doesn't conflate
    //      cross-subtree variants.
    //   2. The current package's own `pkg.dependencies` entry — the
    //      BFS peer-walk enqueued this peer with the declared range,
    //      so whatever got picked there is guaranteed to satisfy.
    //      Captures the case where a single subtree holds two
    //      consumers with conflicting peer ranges (lib-a@^17 next to
    //      a parent that pins react@18): the BFS auto-installs the
    //      satisfying version into lib-a's own deps, which beats the
    //      ancestor's incompatible version.
    //   3. Ancestor scope — even when the version doesn't satisfy
    //      the declared range. This mirrors what Node's module
    //      resolution would surface (`require('peer')` from the
    //      package would walk up node_modules and find the parent's
    //      version). pnpm and bun do the same and emit an unmet-peer
    //      warning rather than picking a more-distant matching
    //      version. `detect_unmet_peers` flags the mismatch after
    //      the pass.
    //   4. The current package's own `pkg.dependencies` entry,
    //      ignoring range satisfaction — symmetric to (3) for the
    //      BFS-installed case.
    //   5. Workspace root scope (compatible) — `resolve-peers-from-
    //      workspace-root` fallback for monorepos that pin shared
    //      peers at the root.
    //   6. A graph-wide scan: any package whose name matches and
    //      whose version satisfies the declared range. Last resort
    //      for nested-context callers when nothing closer has it.
    //   7. Workspace root scope, ignoring range satisfaction.
    //
    // If nothing in the graph holds a version of this peer at all,
    // it's left out of the context entirely — `detect_unmet_peers`
    // will surface it as a warning after the pass.
    //
    // Only peers the package actually *declares* in `peerDependencies`
    // build a dep_path suffix here. A name present solely in
    // `peerDependenciesMeta` (a meta-only optional peer — the way

    // whenever a peer-free path exists, so the realistic lockfile leaves
    // the whole chain bare even when a distant ancestor carries that peer
    // as a plain dependency. Eagerly binding the meta-only peer from that
    // ancestor scope produced `(peer@ver)`-suffixed variants that aube's
    // dedupe pass (which only collapses *declared*-peer variants) never
    // merged, so the same subtree hashed differently per install scope
    // (whole-workspace vs single-member), splitting a shared
